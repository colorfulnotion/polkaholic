## 2023 Roadmap / Open Bounty Program

A partial list of what we can hope to achieve using GAR in 2023:
* Rapidly adapt to XCMv3/... changes
* Augment standardized/custom "weight/fee" information
* Support MultiLocation users, e.g. DEXes, bridge monitors, APIs, Cross-Chain Indexers
* Augment each asset in the result with a “pageRank” type reflecting degree of support by parachains, such that dapp developers can threshold on this attribute, where more parachains supporting an asset will apply
* [something else you and your team think is important]

## Funding / Call for Contributors

We (a collective of people working on this project) seek $125K/quarterly budget in 2023 to support:
* 20% Colorful Notion (Q1/Q2 2023)
* 50% 10-12 parachain developers + on a quarterly basis [below]
* 10% Some other team (Q3 2023) [elected by 10-12, with primary implementer as tie-breaker]
* 10% Some other team (Q4 2023) [elected by 10-12, with primary implementer as tie-breaker]
* 10% Open bounty request [proposed by 10-12]

We seek 10-12 parachain developers + additional developers request to maintain this very simple but extensible XCM Global Asset registry.  Ideally:
* You should be involved in your parachains (xc)asset registry, have debugged XCM transfers with at least 2+ other parachains, and can speak to how you can represent your fees in 2023 if you’re going non-standard in some way.
* You are comfortable signing up for debugging a pretty simple Javascript dataflow processing problem for your own parachain a couple of times in 2023.  
* You will contribute up to 100 hours/yr from each parachain to support this effort, specifically how things may change with:
    * XCMv3 changes – GlobalConsensus
    * ERC20/721/1155 + PSP22/34/37
    * Kusama/Polkadot bridges
    * Snowfork Ethereum bridge
    * Remote execution “Transact” support
    * [something else you and your team think is important]

Contributors will be invited to a “Polkadot XCM Global Asset Registry” Telegram group.
Contributors will be held to the [Polkadot communities' Code of Conduct](https://github.com/paritytech/polkadot/blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).

## Funding

Funding may be from Treasury (of Polkadot/Kusama or parachains, Web3F, or other sponsors).
